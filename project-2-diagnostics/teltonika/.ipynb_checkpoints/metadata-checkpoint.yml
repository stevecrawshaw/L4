                    <p>Data from Bristol City Council operated passive air quality monitoring devices.
                    Diffusion tubes measure concentrations of a traffic pollutant (nitrogen dioxide or NO<sub>2</sub>).
                    This is separate from the

                    Data are bias adjusted and annualised where required but not distance adjusted.

                    Full details of air quality monitoring results are reported to Defra on an annual basis.
