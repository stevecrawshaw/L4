-   Reporting and Impact
-   Recommendations and Conclusions

## Summary

- A Reproducible Analytic Pipeline (RAP) to collate, summarise and report
the key parameters of an air quality monitoring network to provide
timely and evidenced data quality assurance and predictive risk
mitigation.\

- The audience is a small team of air quality specialists in a council supporting a
network of air quality monitors.

## Business Context: Air Quality Management

## Business Problem

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   [Clean Air Zone](https://www.cleanairforbristol.org/) (Â£44m)
    -   Highly politically sensitive
    -   **Relies on air quality data**
    -   Prescriptive QA regime
    -   But human and system error creates **data quality risk**
-   Solution
    -   **Reproducible pipeline for data quality analysis**

## Data Quality Requirements

-   Data collection better than 85% for hourly data
-   4G data use below 3GB per site
-   Identification of analyser system faults
-   Instrument calibration
-   Data scaled to span gas
    -   Identify gas issues asap

## Data Sources

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Teledyne API T200 NOx analysers
-   EnviDAS FW data loggers (SQL Server)
-   Teltonika 4G routers
    -   RMS platform
-   Azure SQL Server (all sites)
-   Google sheets (calibration data)

## Data Analysis - R packages

::: columns

-   DBI (database access)
-   config (secure parameters)
-   tidyverse (wrangling)
-   openair (air quality)
-   gt (tables)

## Data Analysis - Diagnostics

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Air quality data
    -   Missingness
-   Instrument diagnostics
    -   Operating parameters
        -   Temperature
        -   Flowrates
        -   Pressure

S15 ggplot faceted plot to give lots of info in one chart show lines for
optimal ranges

## Data Analysis - Calibration

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Zero and Span
    -   red lines indicates optimal values

S15 used gt to produce attractive table
:::

## Data Analysis - Calibration

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Span divergence
    -   NO and NOx
    -   Gas contamination
    -   NO is oxidised to NO~2~
    -   Affects span and accuracy

## Reproducible Analytical Pipelines

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   [`targets` package](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/)
-   RAP automates function execution
-   Skips redundant steps
-   Encourages functional style
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/tar-visnetwork.png)
:::
:::

::: notes
Targets - similar to make in python bash
:::

## Reporting

-   Monthly report
-   Select start and end dates
-   Rendered in html by Quarto
-   Quarto reads the objects in the `targets` store
-   Some minimal formatting with `gt` package
-   HTML output can be shared with engineers

::: notes
:::

## Impact

-   Data quality risks identified and mitigated
-   Diagnostics report to engineers produced automatically
-   Predictive response to gas contamination issues

## Business Recommendations

-   Extend analytics with dashboard
-   Investigate:
    -   BAM diagnostics (PM~10~, PM~2.5~)
    -   Data logger diagnostics
-   Consolidate with data ratification
-   Add public reporting
-   Include alerts for key parameters
-   Write R package & containerise
